You are a senior frontend engineer and security UX designer.

I already have a working React + Tailwind UI for a Web3 security product called Walletwork.
The current UI only shows a final verdict.

Your task is to EXTEND the UI to display a DETAILED, EXPLAINABLE, STAGE-BY-STAGE SECURITY ANALYSIS.

DO NOT redesign the whole UI.
DO NOT remove the existing layout.
EXTEND the right-hand “Results Panel” only.

========================
GOAL
========================
For every transaction analysis, the user must see:

1. Each analysis phase
2. What was checked in that phase
3. The outcome of that phase
4. How it contributed to the final risk score
5. A final consolidated verdict

This is meant for judges and security reviewers.
Explainability is MORE IMPORTANT than visual flash.

========================
ANALYSIS PHASES TO DISPLAY
========================

PHASE 1 — Static Checks
Label: “Static Validation”
Checks:
- Address format
- Zero address / burn address
- Known scam blacklist
Output:
- Status: PASS / FAIL
- Short explanation in plain English

PHASE 2 — On-Chain Intelligence
Label: “On-Chain Signals”
Checks:
- Wallet transaction count (fresh wallet detection)
- Contract age
- Is contract vs EOA
- Contract verification status (Etherscan)
Output:
- Signals shown as badges:
  - “Fresh Wallet”
  - “Unverified Contract”
  - “New Contract”
- Short explanation of why each signal matters

PHASE 3 — Graph Intelligence
Label: “Graph Risk Analysis”
Checks:
- Hop distance to known scam wallets
- Direct or indirect exposure
Output:
- Hop distance visualized (0 Hop, 1 Hop, 2+ Hops)
- Clear explanation:
  “This wallet has directly interacted with a known scam address.”

PHASE 4 — Transaction Simulation
Label: “Transaction Impact Simulation”
Checks:
- Transaction type (Approve / Swap / Send)
- Approval risk (unlimited allowance)
- Historical drain patterns
Output:
- Drain probability (%)
- Explanation of worst-case outcome
- Highlight if approval enables future token drain

========================
FINAL VERDICT SECTION
========================

After all phases, show a FINAL SUMMARY CARD:

- Final Risk Level: SAFE / CAUTION / DANGEROUS
- Risk Score (0–100)
- “Why this verdict?” section summarizing top 3 reasons
- Clear recommendation:
  - “Safe to proceed”
  - “Proceed with caution”
  - “Do NOT sign this transaction”

========================
UI BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENTS
========================

- Each phase should be collapsible (accordion-style)
- Default state: expanded after analysis
- Each phase should have:
  - Title
  - Status indicator (green / amber / red)
  - Explanation text
- Use icons and subtle color accents ONLY (no neon)

========================
DATA ASSUMPTIONS
========================

Assume backend response contains:

{
  risk_level,
  risk_score,
  reasons,
  signals: {
    is_new_wallet,
    is_unverified_contract,
    graph_hop_distance,
    drain_probability,
    contract_age_days
  }
}

If some signals are missing, fail gracefully and display:
“Data unavailable”

========================
DESIGN CONSTRAINTS
========================

- Dark theme (already exists)
- Glassmorphism cards
- Clean, calm, security-first tone
- NO buzzwords
- NO emojis
- NO marketing language

========================
WHAT TO OUTPUT
========================

- Updated React JSX for the Results Panel
- Reusable components:
  - PhaseCard
  - SignalBadge
  - VerdictSummary
- Tailwind classes inline (no external CSS)
- Clear comments explaining structure

IMPORTANT:
This is a SECURITY EXPLANATION INTERFACE.
The user must understand WHY a transaction is dangerous — not just that it is.

Do not simplify.
Do not hide technical truth.
Do not remove existing functionality.

Implement this carefully and cleanly.
