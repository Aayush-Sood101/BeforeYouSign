1️⃣ Is the Phase-2 output correct for your inputs?
Inputs
Wallet (wid):
0xa6b71e26c5e0845f74c812102017114b6a896ab2

“Contract” (cid):
0xa6b71e26c5e0845f74c802102ca7114b6a896ab2

Output summary

Wallet tx count: 0

Wallet labeled: Fresh Wallet

“Contract” labeled: EOA

Phase status: WARNING

✅ Verdict: YES, THIS IS CORRECT

Nothing here is contradictory or misleading.

2️⃣ Why are you seeing EOA so often?

Because most Ethereum addresses are EOAs, not contracts.

This is not a bug.
This is how Ethereum works.

3️⃣ What is an EOA? (Explain this clearly)
EOA = Externally Owned Account

An EOA is a normal wallet.

Examples:

MetaMask wallet

Ledger wallet

Exchange wallet

Any address created from a private key

Key properties of EOAs
Property	EOA
Has private key	✅ Yes
Can sign transactions	✅ Yes
Can execute code	❌ No
Has bytecode	❌ No
Can be verified on Etherscan	❌ No

EOAs cannot contain logic.
They can only:

Send ETH

Send tokens

Call smart contracts

4️⃣ What is a Smart Contract then?

A smart contract:

Has bytecode deployed on-chain

Executes automatically

Does NOT have a private key

Can drain funds if malicious

Examples of real contracts

Uniswap Router

ERC-20 token contracts

NFT contracts

Drainer contracts

Only contracts can be:

Verified

Unverified

Audited

5️⃣ Why your “contract address” is an EOA

You are passing:

cid = 0xa6b71e26c5e0845f74c802102ca7114b6a896ab2


Alchemy correctly reports:

No bytecode → EOA

That means:

This address is just a wallet

There is no contract logic to inspect

Verification does not apply

Your UI handles this correctly by saying:

“Contract-level risks do not apply”

That’s exactly right.

6️⃣ Why EOAs appear MOST of the time in testing
Typical testing behavior

You often test with:

Random addresses

Wallet addresses

Fresh MetaMask addresses

Exchange wallets

All of these are EOAs.

Smart contracts appear only when:

You interact with:

DeFi protocols

Tokens

DApps

You explicitly paste a contract address

7️⃣ How to intentionally test a SMART CONTRACT

If you want Phase-2 to show Smart Contract + Verification, use known contracts.

Verified contract examples (safe for demo)

Uniswap V2 Router

0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D


USDT (ERC-20 token)

0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7


These will show:

is_contract = true

contract_verified = true

Unverified contract example (for WARNING demo)

Use a newly deployed token contract from Etherscan that says:

“Contract Source Code Not Verified”

(You can find these under “New Contracts” on Etherscan.)

8️⃣ How to explain this to judges (IMPORTANT)

If a judge asks:

“Why is this address an EOA?”

Say this:

“Ethereum has two types of accounts: EOAs and smart contracts. EOAs are normal wallets that can sign transactions but contain no executable code. Since EOAs cannot run logic, contract-level risks like hidden code or malicious functions do not apply.”

This is 100% correct and shows deep understanding.

9️⃣ Why Phase-2 still warns here

Even though the “contract” is an EOA:

Wallet is fresh

Fresh wallets increase uncertainty

So:

WARNING is correct

Not SAFE, not DANGEROUS.

10️⃣ TL;DR (memorize this)

EOAs are normal wallets with no executable code.
Most Ethereum addresses are EOAs.
Contract verification only applies to addresses with bytecode.
Seeing EOA frequently is expected and correct.
