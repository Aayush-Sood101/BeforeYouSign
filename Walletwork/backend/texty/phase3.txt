PHASE 3 — GRAPH RISK ANALYSIS
--------------------------------
“Who has this wallet interacted with, and how close is it to known scams?”

1. CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW
Phase 3 models the blockchain as a transaction graph.

- Nodes: wallet addresses
- Edges: transactions between wallets
- Scam wallets: flagged malicious nodes

The goal is to measure how many transaction steps (hops) separate a wallet from known scam wallets.

This answers:
“How close is this wallet to known scam activity?”

This is correlation-based risk analysis, not proof of guilt.

--------------------------------
2. WHAT IS HOP DISTANCE
A hop is one transaction link.

Hop Distance Meaning:
- 0 hops: Wallet is a known scam OR directly flagged
- 1 hop: Wallet directly transacted with a scam
- 2 hops: Wallet transacted with someone who transacted with a scam
- 3+ hops: Weak / indirect exposure
- null / unknown: No known path to scams

Real-world analogy:
- You → scammer = 0 hops
- You → friend → scammer = 1 hop
- You → friend → friend → scammer = 2 hops

Closer distance = higher risk.

--------------------------------
3. WHAT THE BACKEND DOES
Phase 3 logic:

Inputs:
- Wallet address
- Recent transaction counterparts (from Alchemy)
- Known scam addresses (scam_db.json)
- Scam clusters (if implemented)

Process:
- Build a local transaction graph
- Compare wallet’s transaction neighbors against scam nodes
- Compute minimum hop distance

If no path exists:
- Hop distance = null (or unknown)

--------------------------------
4. UI INTERPRETATION (NULL HOPS)
If the UI shows:
“Hop Distance: null”

This means:
- Graph analysis ran successfully
- No known transaction path to current scam intelligence
- No proximity-based risk detected

IMPORTANT:
Null hops ≠ safe
It means “no known exposure,” not “clean wallet.”

--------------------------------
5. WHY NULL HOPS ARE NORMAL
Null hops are expected in an MVP because:

- Ethereum has hundreds of millions of wallets
- scam_db.json contains ~10 addresses
- Most wallets have never interacted with those few addresses

Mathematically:
Probability(wallet touches one of 10 scam addresses) ≈ extremely low

This is NOT a bug.
This is how real security intelligence works.

Even professional tools often show:
- “No known illicit exposure”
- “No direct links detected”

Security tools detect known risks — not all risks.

--------------------------------
6. WHEN PHASE 3 BECOMES CRITICAL

0 Hops (CRITICAL):
- Wallet is directly flagged or directly linked to a scam
UI message:
“This wallet is directly linked to a known scam cluster. Do not interact.”

1 Hop (HIGH RISK):
- Wallet directly transacted with a scam
UI message:
“This wallet has directly interacted with a known scam address.”

2 Hops (MEDIUM RISK):
- Indirect exposure
UI message:
“This wallet has indirect exposure to scam activity.”

null / 3+ Hops (LOW GRAPH RISK):
- No known proximity
UI message:
“No known scam proximity detected.”

--------------------------------
7. ROLE IN FINAL VERDICT
Phase 3 NEVER decides safety alone.

Why:
- Scammers rotate wallets
- New scams aren’t in databases yet
- Legit wallets can accidentally interact with bad ones

Phase 3 provides a signal, not a verdict.

Typical weighting:
- 0 hops: +40 to +60 risk
- 1 hop: +25 risk
- 2 hops: +10 risk
- null: +0 risk

Final verdict combines:
Static checks + On-chain intelligence + Graph risk + Simulation

--------------------------------
8. HOW TO EXPLAIN TO JUDGES (SCRIPT)
“Phase 3 uses graph analysis. We model the blockchain as a transaction graph and measure how many hops away a wallet is from known scam addresses. A null hop result means no known scam exposure was detected in our current intelligence dataset. It does not imply safety, only absence of known links.”

--------------------------------
9. WHY PHASE 3 STILL MATTERS
Even with a small scam database:

- Proves correct security architecture
- Demonstrates graph-based risk modeling
- Catches known scam cases for demo
- Integrates cleanly with risk scoring
- Scales automatically as intelligence grows

Scam databases expand over time.
The architecture does not need to change.

--------------------------------
FINAL TAKEAWAY
Yes — most Phase 3 results will show null hops with ~10 scam addresses.
This is expected, correct, and acceptable for an MVP.

Phase 3 is about risk signals, not certainty.
