PHASE 2 — On-Chain Intelligence

(What is actually happening here?)

One-line purpose (memorize this)

Phase 2 asks: “What does the blockchain itself reveal about this wallet and contract?”

No opinions.
No prior labels.
Only objective on-chain facts.

This phase does not decide guilt.
It establishes context and credibility.

Why Phase 2 exists at all

If you skip Phase 2, you only have:

Blacklists (Phase 1)

Graph proximity (Phase 3)

Heuristics (Phase 4)

Judges will immediately ask:

“What if the address is not yet blacklisted?”

Phase 2 answers that.

It catches new scams, fresh wallets, and suspicious contracts before they’re widely reported.

What Phase 2 uses (important distinction)
Inputs

Wallet address

Contract address

Data sources

Alchemy → raw blockchain data

Etherscan → contract transparency & verification

What it does NOT use

❌ scam_db.json
❌ graph logic
❌ transaction simulation

This is intentional.

Phase 2 is split into TWO tracks
Track A — Wallet Intelligence
Track B — Contract Intelligence

Let’s break them down.

Track A — Wallet Intelligence

This answers:

“Who am I dealing with?”

1️⃣ Wallet Transaction Count (Fresh Wallet Detection)

What we check

Number of transactions ever sent by the wallet

Why this matters

Scammers generate wallets instantly

Fresh wallets have:

No reputation

No history

No accountability

Interpretation

tx_count == 0 → Fresh Wallet

Fresh ≠ scam, but high risk

How you explain it to judges

“Legitimate users accumulate transaction history over time. Scam operators frequently rotate brand-new wallets to avoid traceability.”

2️⃣ Wallet Age (Implicit via history)

We don’t need an explicit “creation date”.

If a wallet has:

Many past transactions

Spread over time

→ It’s less likely to be a throwaway scam wallet.

This contributes to risk weighting, not a verdict.

Track B — Contract Intelligence

This answers:

“What am I interacting with?”

3️⃣ Is this a Contract or a Person?

What we check

Does bytecode exist at this address?

Why

EOAs (people) behave differently from contracts

Contracts execute unavoidable code

This matters for:

Approve

Swap

Any programmable action

4️⃣ Contract Age

What we check

How recently the contract appeared on-chain

Why this matters

Scam contracts are often:

Deployed minutes or hours before attack

Abandoned after draining funds

Interpretation

Very new contract → elevated risk

Old contract → more trust (not guaranteed)

5️⃣ Contract Verification (Etherscan)

This is one of your strongest signals.

What we check

Is the contract source code verified on Etherscan?

Why this matters

Legitimate projects want transparency

Scammers hide code intentionally

Rule (clear and defensible)

Unverified contract = HIGH RISK

This is not opinion — it’s industry norm.

Judge-friendly explanation

“If the code isn’t public, users cannot audit what will happen when they interact with it. That lack of transparency itself is a risk signal.”

What Phase 2 outputs (and what it DOESN’T)
Phase 2 outputs signals, not a verdict

Examples:

Fresh Wallet

Unverified Contract

New Contract

EOA vs Contract

Each signal:

Has meaning

Adds weight

Is explainable

Phase 2 alone never says:

“This is a scam.”

It says:

“These conditions increase uncertainty and risk.”

How Phase 2 contributes to the final risk score

Think of Phase 2 as risk multipliers, not triggers.

Example logic (conceptual)

Fresh wallet → +15

Unverified contract → +25

New contract → +10

These numbers:

Don’t ban

Don’t block

Just tilt the balance

Later phases decide severity.
