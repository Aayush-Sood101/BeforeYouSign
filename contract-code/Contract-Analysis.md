## Critical Risk Points for Smart Contract Implementation

### ⚠️ Must-Implement Protections:
1. **Fee Caps:** Borrow Fee, Late Fee (3%), Early Termination Fee (50%)
2. **Timeframes:** 24hr margin calls, 7-day invoice payment, 10-day Hard Fork payment
3. **Collateral Rights:** Borrower must be able to reclaim after repayment + 10 confirmations
4. **Default Triggers:** Must match Section VII and VIII exactly
5. **Cross-Default:** One default triggers all loans
6. **Ownership Rights:** Correct Hard Fork/Airdrop distribution to Lender vs Borrower

### ⚠️ Common Attack Vectors:
1. **Hidden owner privileges** that bypass Borrower rights
2. **Undisclosed fees** beyond agreed rates
3. **Premature collateral seizure** before default conditions met
4. **Bypassing margin call grace periods**
5. **Incorrect Hard Fork token distribution**
6. **Preventing legitimate early repayment**
7. **Excessive or undefined Late Fees**
8. **Failure to honor Market Disruption Event protections**

---

## Conclusion

This agreement establishes a complex DeFi lending relationship with multiple safeguards for both parties. Any smart contract implementation must precisely mirror these legal obligations, particularly around:

- **Temporal constraints** (deadlines, grace periods)
- **Fee calculations** (exact formulas, caps)
- **Default conditions** (specific triggers)
- **Collateral management** (when it can be seized)
- **Token distributions** (Hard Forks/Airdrops)

**Any deviation from these terms would constitute a breach of contract and expose users to financial loss.**
